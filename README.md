# SimpleBP
SimpleBP is, needless to say, an extremely minimalistic build protection system for Garry's Mod. Players lose build protection when entering a vehicle or pulling out a weapon, and regain it upon respawning.
# Installation
Pop the addon into your server and you're good to go. No configuration is required.
